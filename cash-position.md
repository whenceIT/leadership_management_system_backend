PARAMETER 6: CASH & LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT INDEX (CLMI)

The One Number: Cash Health Score (0-100%)
This parameter measures how well branches, districts, provinces, units, department or the institution is managing physical cash and electronic float balances, balancing security risk against liquidity needs. This parameter addresses default risk (poor or relaxed vetting when with too much cash), theft/fraud risk (when with too much cash) and operational risk (too little cash).
Critical Design Principle: AVOIDING CANCELATION
One critical design issue to avoid is that if two (02) branches from the same district, province or looked at institutional wide, simple averaging would hide problems:
Branch	Cash Balance	Status	Problem
Branch A	K45,000	Too High	Theft risk, relaxed vetting (defaults)
Branch B	K5,000	Too Low	Liquidity crisis
Average	K25,000	Looks Fine!	⚠️ BOTH PROBLEMS HIDDEN
Solution: The index must measure DEVIATION from optimal range, not central tendency. Each branch is scored on how far it is from the ideal range, then those scores are averaged. This ensures problems compound rather than cancel.


Optimal Cash Range (From Guidelines)
Threshold	Value	Implication
Absolute Minimum	K20,000	Below this = liquidity problems
Ideal Range - Lower	K20,000	Minimum acceptable
Ideal Range - Upper	K30,000	Standard maximum
Exceptional Maximum	K50,000	Only with approved reason (rentals, recruitment, etc)
Above K50,000	Critical	Automatic red flag

Constituent Metrics
Constituent	What It Measures	Target	Weight
Cash Position Score	How close branch is to ideal range (K20k-30k)	Within range	40%
Above-Threshold Risk	Value of cash held above K30,000 (unapproved)	Zero	30%
Below-Threshold Risk	Value of cash held below K20,000 (liquidity risk)	Zero	20%
Approved Exception Ratio	% of above-range cash with valid approval	100% approved	10%

Normalization Logic
1. Cash Position Score (40% weight)
Scenario	Score	Calculation
Cash between K20,000 – K30,000	100%	Perfect – within ideal range
Cash between K30,000 – K50,000	Declining 100% → 60%	Penalty increases as cash rises
Cash above K50,000	0%	Critical – automatic zero
Cash between K10,000 – K20,000	Declining 100% → 50%	Penalty increases as cash falls
Cash below K10,000	0%	Critical – automatic zero
Formula Example:
If cash = K35,000 (above range):
Range excess = K5,000
Penalty = (excess / K20,000) × 40%
Score = 100% - penalty = 100% - 10% = 90%
2. Above-Threshold Risk (30% weight)
Measures total unapproved cash above K30,000. This is a PROXY for theft/fraud risk.
Score = 100% × (1 - (Unapproved Excess / Total Cash))

Example:
- Total Cash: K45,000
- Approved Excess (e.g., rentals): K10,000
- Unapproved Excess: K5,000
- Score = 100% × (1 - 5,000/45,000) = 89%
3. Below-Threshold Risk (20% weight)
Measures liquidity shortage – cash below K20,000.
Score = 100% × (Cash Balance / K20,000) [capped at 100%]

Example:
- Cash: K15,000
- Score = 100% × (15,000/20,000) = 75%
4. Approved Exception Ratio (10% weight)
Ensures governance – any cash above K30,000 must have approval from immediate supervisor through the system.
Score = (Approved Excess Amount / Total Excess Amount) × 100%

Example:
- Total above K30,000: K15,000
- Approved: K10,000
- Unapproved: K5,000
- Score = (10,000/15,000) × 100% = 67%
How Cancelation Is Prevented
Wrong Approach (Averaging raw balances):
Branch A: K45,000
Branch B: K5,000
Average: K25,000 → Looks fine! (MISLEADING)
Correct Approach (Averaging DEVIATION scores):
Branch	Cash	Position Score (40%)	Above Risk (30%)	Below Risk (20%)	Approval (10%)	Branch Score
A	K45,000	70%	89%	100%	67%	79.4%
B	K5,000	0%	100%	25%	100%	45.0%
District Average						62.2% ⚠️
Result: Both problems are VISIBLE in the consolidated score. No cancelation.

Consolidated View at Different Levels
Level	What the Score Represents
Branch	How well that specific branch manages cash
District	Average of branch DEVIATION scores (problems don't cancel)
Province	Average of district DEVIATION scores
Institution	Average of province DEVIATION scores
Technical Implementation Notes
1)	Always score DEVIATION from optimal, not absolute values
2)	Store approval flags in system for any cash >K30,000
3)	Alert thresholds:
	Red: Any branch <K10,000 or >K50,000
	Amber: Any branch K10,000-20,000 or K30,000-50,000 unapproved
	You can even indicate number of branches, districts or provinces causing a certain adverse position whenever possible
4)	Trend analysis: Track how long branches remain outside optimal range
5)	Approval tracking: Link to digital approval workflow for exceptions
Summary
This parameter ensures:
	Theft risk is monitored (too much cash)
	Liquidity risk is monitored (too little cash)
	Governance is enforced (approved exceptions only)
	Consolidated figures reveal problems rather than hiding them
